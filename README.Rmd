```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This is a super small example that uses Snakemake to get fastq files from
the Short Read Archive using `fasterq-dump`.  We originally tried to use the
Snakemake wrapper for this, but that seemed to make SUMMIT unhappy, so we
just went minimal and do it with a simple shell block.

Note that the output file names can't be changed without messing with
the shell script (i.e., the `-O` option to fasterq-dump).  So, this isn't
super general, but it will work.

It is configured so that rule all downloads the first five pearl millet
accessions from the SRA.  

To run this on SUMMIT, on an interactive shell _on a compute node_, first
make sure that necessary conda environment is installed.
```sh
conda activate snakemake 


```
